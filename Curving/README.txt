curving.cpp, curving.h, and main.cpp contain code using vectors.
other files contain code for statistics of the data, functions need to be updated to work with vectors and merged into the files listed above

curving.cpp updated to have performCurve function, which is an all-encompassing function that can be called after the curving object is created. This function should provide all the functionality needed from curving. Up next we need to contact the automation group to figure out the format they will be pushing us data to make sure our programs are compatible
